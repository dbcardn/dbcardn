    "1. `Theoretical questions:` you will be asked to provide short derivations and/or a proof. For the `theoretical questions`, please write your answers on a paper sheet. When you are done, you should scan your work with your phone to upload it on Canvas, as you did for the assignments.\n",
    "2. `Coding in Python:` For the `coding questions`, you are given a code (below) which has a few missing parts. Your job is to complete it. The data for this exercise are in `ccapmmonthlydata.xls`. When you are done, you should upload your Python code on Canvas.\n",
